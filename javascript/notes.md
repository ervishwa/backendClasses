Promises ------------

Async opertaion in js..-> handel prmoise use.
its  a object which is used to handel async operation in js.

it has three state...

pending

rejected

state ,
result

till the state is in pending state result will be undefined.

how do we know when the state of a promise changes?

que -> after promise fullfilled/resolve then i want to clg("i have  done my work");

here promise obj has 3 inbuit methods..

then -> resolve
catch -> reject
finally -> always..
